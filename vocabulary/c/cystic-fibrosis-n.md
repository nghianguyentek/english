### Biology - a progressive, genetic disease that affects the lungs, pancreas, and other organs

- In people with CF, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause the CFTR protein to become dysfunction. When the protein is not working correctly, it's unable to help move chloride - a component of salt - to the cell surface. Without the chloride to attract water to the cell surface, the mucus in various organs becomes thick and sticky.
