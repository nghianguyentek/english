abbr. **SCN**

## 1.

### Psychology - a small region of the hypothalamus in the brain, above the optic chiasm, that is the location of the circadian oscillator, which controls circadian rhythms. It receives direct input from the retina.

- Important factors in these changes are biological rhythms, and, more specifically, the circadian rhythms generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
- The brain's clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
- The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the amount of light present, allowing this internal clock to be synchronised with the outside world.
