# biological taxonomy (n)

## 1.

### the science of the classification of organisms. Traditional classifications group organisms into a hierarchical system of ranks, in ascending order: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. Species are named using binomial nomenclature, devised by Swedish biologist Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) in 1758: each species is given two names, the first for the genus to which it belongs and the second identifying the species itself; thus, human being classified as Homo sapiens.
