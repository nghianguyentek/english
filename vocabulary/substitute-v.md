# substitute (v)

/ˈsʌbstɪtjuːt/

## to take the place of somebody/something else; to use somebody/something instead of somebody/something else

- One way to see this is to substitute [actual](actual-adj.md#used-to-emphasize-something-that-is-real-or-exists-in-fact) [propositions](proposition-n.md#a-statement-of-a-theorem-and-an-explanation-of-how-it-can-be-proved) for p and q, such as p: Two is even, and q: Three is odd.
