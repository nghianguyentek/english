# deterministic (adj)

/dɪˌtɜːmɪˈnɪstɪk/

## connected with the belief that people are not free to choose what they are like or how they behave, because these things are decided by their environment and other things over which they have no control (tính xác định; tính khẳng định; tất định)

- In terms of behavior, we can distinguish deterministic and stochastic phenomena.
