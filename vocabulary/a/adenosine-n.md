### Biochemistry - a compound, C10H13N5O4, consisting of adenine combined with ribose, one of four nucleoside units in RNA

- A compound in living cells consisting of an adenine molecule and a ribose sugar molecule. Adenosine functions as a neuromodulator: By binding to special adenosine receptors, it influences the release of several neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Combined with three phosphate units, adenosine becomes ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate), which functions as an energy source in metabolic activities.
