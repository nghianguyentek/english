### Psychology - a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by markedly impaired social interactions and verbal and nonverbal communication; narrow interests; and repetitive behaviour. Manifestations and features of the disorder appear before age 3 but vary greatly across children according to developmental level, language skills, and chronological age. They may include a lack of awareness of the feelings of others, impaired ability to imitate, absence of social play, abnormal speech, abnormal nonverbal communication, and a preference for maintaining environmental sameness. Classified in DSM-IV-TR as a pervasive developmental disorder, autism was integrated into autism spectrum disorder in DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR and is no longer considered a distinct diagnosis.
