## 1.

### Psychology - partial or complete loss of memory. Either temporary or permanent, it may be due to physiological factors such as injury or disease (organic amnesia), to substance use (drug-induced amnesia), or to psychological factors such as a trauma experience (dissociative amnesia). A disturbance in memory marked by inability to learn new information is call anterograde amnesia, and one marked by inability to recall previously learned information or pass events is call retrograde amnesia. When severe enough to interfere markedly with social or occupational functioning or to represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning, the memory loss is known as amnesiac disorder
