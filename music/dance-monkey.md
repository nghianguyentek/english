They say oh my god I see the way you shine 
Take your hands my dear and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time 
Ohhh I 
See you see you seen you every time 
and oh my I, I like you style 
You, you make me make me make me wanna cry 
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time 

So they say 
Dance for me
Dance for me 
Dance for me 
Oh oh oh 
I’ve never seen anybody do the things you do before 
They say
Move for me 
Move for me 
Move for me 
Eh eh eh 
And when you’re done i'll make you do it all again 

I said 
Oh my god I see you walking by 
Take my hands my dear and look me in my eyes
Just like a monkey I’ve been dancing my whole life 
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time 
Ooh I 
See you see you seen you every time
And oh my I, I like your style 
You, you make me make me make me wanna cry 
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time 

So they say 
Dance for me

Dance for me 
Oh oh oh

They say
