# Watermelon Moonshine

Lainey Wilson

```
Verse 1
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER SENIOR YEAR
JUST BEFORE THE SUMMER DISAPPEARED
WE WENT RIDING THEM OLD FARM RUTS
HANGING OUT ON THE GATE OF HIS TRUCK
WE THREW A BLANKET NEATH THE SUNSET
BEING BRAVE AS EIGHTEEN GETS
WE GAVE EACH OTHER MORE THAN OUR HEARTS
WITH THE HELP OF A MASON JAR

CHORUS
DRINKING WATERMELON MOONSHINE
WE CUT THE BURN WITH A LITTLE LIME
PARKING BACK IN THEM KUDZU VINES
I WAS HIS AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BOY WAS MINE
TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
BUT WE WERE LEARNING ON A SWEET BUZZ
THERE’S NEVER NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TIME
AND MINE’S ALWAYS GONNA TASTE LIKE
WATERMELON MOONSHINE

Verse 2
I DON’T REMEMBER WHERE WE GOT IT FROM
I JUST REMEMBER FEELING ALL GROWN UP
TAKING PULLS LIKE IT AINT NO THING
NEVER TOLD HIM IT WAS MY FIRST DRINK
BUT I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONE
YOU'RE SO SURE WHEN YOU'RE THAT YOUNG
YOU THINK YOU GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT
AND NOW I LAUGH WHEN I THINK ABOUT

CHORUS
DRINKING WATERMELON MOONSHINE
WE CUT THE BURN WITH A LITTLE LIME
PARKING BACK IN THEM KUDZU VINES
I WAS HIS AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BOY WAS MINE
TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
BUT WE WERE LEARNING ON A SWEET BUZZ
THERE’S NEVER NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TIME
AND MINE’S ALWAYS GONNA TASTE LIKE
WATERMELON MOONSHINE

BRIDGE
I THOUGHT THAT HIGH WOULD LAST FOREVER
BUT THAT AIN’T WHAT IT DOES
MAYBE WE WERE DRUNK IN LOVE
OR MAYBE WE WERE JUST


CHORUS
DRINKING WATERMELON MOONSHINE
WE CUT THE BURN WITH A LITTLE LIME
PARKING BACK IN THEM KUDZU VINES
I WAS HIS AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BOY WAS MINE
TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
BUT WE WERE LEARNING ON A SWEET BUZZ
THERE’S NEVER NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TIME
AND MINE’S ALWAYS GONNA TASTE LIKE
WATERMELON MOONSHINE
WATERMELON MOONSHINE
