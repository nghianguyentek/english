    She never wanted to be white picket fenced in
    Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
    Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
    And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
    She'll wreck your world
    And leave before the mornin' sun
    But here she is, free, layin' next to me
    'Cause I ain't tryna to tame her love
    I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
    Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
    She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
    Just looking for somebody as wild as her
    Wild, wild
    Saw that highway unwind in her deep brown eyes
    She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
    She ain't living for a diamond ring
    Just living like the rock'n'roll song she sings out loud
    We're burnin' it down
    Blazin' up a trail of smoke
    Wherever we are, wherever we go
    Yeah, that's where she calls home
    I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
    Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
    She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
    Just looking for somebody as wild as her
    Wild, wild
    Yeah, man
    Yeah, I ain't tryna fix her
    I just wanna kiss her
    Fuel a little fire in her soul
    But we don't say forever, but when we're together
    Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go
    'Cause she knows
    I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
    Keep her heart hanging on 'round every turn
    She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
    Just looking for somebody as wild as her
    Wild, wild
    Yeah
